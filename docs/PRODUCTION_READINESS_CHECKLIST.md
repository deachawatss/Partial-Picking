- [ ] Release build successful (`cargo build --release`)
- [ ] Binary size acceptable (<30 MB)
- [ ] No unsafe code blocks (or documented/justified)
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Logging configured for production (info level)

**Verification**:
```bash
cd backend
cargo test
cargo fmt -- --check
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo build --release
ls -lh target/release/partial-picking-backend.exe
```

**Verification**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm test

---

## 2. Constitutional Compliance

### 8 Core Principles

- [ ] **Contract-First Development**: All APIs match openapi.yaml
- [ ] **Type Safety**: TypeScript strict mode + Rust compile-time guarantees
- [ ] **TDD with Failing Tests**: All tests written first (and passed)
- [ ] **Atomic Transactions**: 4-phase picking executes atomically
- [ ] **Real-Time Performance**: WebSocket latency <200ms verified
- [ ] **Security by Default**: JWT auth, CORS, input validation, parameterized queries
- [ ] **Audit Trail Preservation**: Audit metadata preserved (ItemBatchStatus, PickingDate)
- [ ] **No Artificial Keys**: Composite keys used (RunNo, RowNum, LineId)

**Verification**:
- Review: `CONSTITUTIONAL_COMPLIANCE_VERIFICATION.md`
- Review: Contract tests in `backend/tests/contract/`
- Review: 4-phase transaction in `picking_service.rs`
