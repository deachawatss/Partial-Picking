---

## Validation Tests

### Test 1: React DevTools Profiler - BatchItemRow Memoization

**Purpose:** Verify that memoization prevents unnecessary row re-renders during weight updates.

**Before Optimization:**
- All 20-100 rows re-render on every weight update
- Profiler shows 20-100 `BatchItemRow` renders per update

**After Optimization (Expected):**
- Only 1 row re-renders when its `pickedQty` changes
- Other rows show "Did not render" in Profiler

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open the Application**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   # Visit http://localhost:6060
   ```

2. **Open React DevTools Profiler**
   - Press `F12` to open Chrome DevTools
   - Click the **⚛️ Components** tab
   - Click the **🔵 Profiler** tab
   - Click the **🔴 Record** button

3. **Perform Picking Workflow**
   - Login with credentials
   - Select a production run (e.g., Run #213972)
   - Select a batch
   - Click on an item in the batch grid
   - Place item on scale (weight updates should appear)
   - Watch weight progress bar update in real-time
   - Click "Save Pick" button

4. **Stop Recording**
   - Click the **⏹️ Stop** button in Profiler
   - DevTools will display a flame graph

5. **Analyze Results**
   - Look for `BatchItemRow` components in the flame graph
   - Click on a `BatchItemRow` in the list
   - Check **"Why did this render?"** section

**Expected Results:**

```
✅ PASS: Only 1 BatchItemRow rendered (the row with updated pickedQty)
✅ PASS: Other 19-99 rows show "Did not render" (memoization working)
✅ PASS: Render time < 16ms (one frame, 60fps maintained)

❌ FAIL: Multiple BatchItemRow renders (memoization broken)
❌ FAIL: "Parent component rendered" for all rows (memo not applied)
```

**Screenshot Checkpoints:**
- Take screenshot of Profiler flame graph showing selective rendering
- Save as `docs/screenshots/phase3-profiler-batchitemrow.png`

---

### Test 2: React DevTools Profiler - WeightProgressBar Memoization

**Purpose:** Verify that WeightProgressBar only re-renders when weight/range props change.

**Before Optimization:**
- WeightProgressBar re-renders on every parent component update
- Complex percentage calculations run unnecessarily

**After Optimization (Expected):**
- WeightProgressBar only re-renders when weight, weightRangeLow, or weightRangeHigh change
- Parent updates (e.g., modal open/close) don't trigger re-render

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Continue from Test 1 Profiler Session** (or start new recording)

2. **Trigger Parent Updates Without Weight Changes**
   - Open Run Selection Modal (parent state change)
   - Close Run Selection Modal
   - Open Bin Selection Modal
   - Close Bin Selection Modal

3. **Trigger Weight Updates**
   - Place item on scale
   - Wait for weight to update
   - Remove item from scale

4. **Stop Recording and Analyze**
   - Look for `WeightProgressBar` in flame graph
   - Check renders during modal open/close (should be 0)
   - Check renders during weight updates (should be multiple)

**Expected Results:**

```
✅ PASS: WeightProgressBar did NOT render when modals opened/closed
✅ PASS: WeightProgressBar DID render when weight prop changed
✅ PASS: Render reason: "Props changed" (weight, weightRangeLow, weightRangeHigh)

❌ FAIL: WeightProgressBar rendered on modal open/close (memo broken)
❌ FAIL: Render reason: "Parent component rendered" (not memoized)
```

---

### Test 3: useDeferredValue Search Performance

**Purpose:** Verify that search input responds instantly without 400ms debounce delay.

**Before Optimization:**
- Typing in search input had 400ms delay (setTimeout debounce)
- UI felt sluggish during fast typing

**After Optimization (Expected):**
- Input updates immediately (React 19 concurrent rendering)
- Filtering happens in background (non-blocking)
- Typing feels instant even with large datasets

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open Run Selection Modal**
   - Click "New Pick" or similar button to open Run Selection Modal
   - Modal shows paginated list of production runs

2. **Test Fast Typing**
   - Type quickly in search input: `"600"`
   - Observe: Input field should show each character **instantly** (no delay)
   - Observe: Loading spinner appears briefly while filtering (⏳ icon)
   - Observe: Results update after typing stops

3. **Measure Input Latency (Performance Tab)**
   - Open Chrome DevTools → **Performance** tab
   - Click **🔴 Record**
   - Type in search input: `"213972"`
   - Stop recording
   - Find the input event in timeline
   - Measure time from keypress to DOM update

**Expected Results:**

```
✅ PASS: Input field updates instantly (<16ms per character)
✅ PASS: Loading spinner (⏳) appears during filtering
✅ PASS: Typing feels smooth and responsive
✅ PASS: Performance tab shows input latency <16ms (one frame)

❌ FAIL: Input has 400ms delay (useDeferredValue not working)
❌ FAIL: No loading indicator during filtering
❌ FAIL: Input latency >100ms (setTimeout fallback active)
```

**Performance Measurement:**
```
Target: Input Event → DOM Update <16ms (one frame, 60fps)
Acceptable: <50ms (20fps, still feels responsive)
Fail: >100ms (noticeable lag)
```

---

### Test 4: WebSocket Latency (Constitutional Requirement)

**Purpose:** Verify that <200ms WebSocket latency is **maintained** after optimizations.

**Constitutional Requirement:**
> "Real-Time Performance: WebSocket weight updates <200ms latency" (Principle #5)

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open Browser DevTools Network Tab**
   - Press `F12` → **Network** tab
   - Filter: `WS` (WebSocket connections only)
   - Start recording

2. **Connect to Weight Scale**
   - Login to application
   - Navigate to picking page
   - WebSocket connection should auto-connect to bridge service

3. **Monitor WebSocket Messages**
   - Place item on scale
   - Watch for `weightUpdate` messages in Network tab
   - Click on a message to view details

4. **Measure Latency**
   - **Method 1: Network Tab Timestamps**
     - Check message timestamp in Network tab
     - Compare to UI update timestamp (use Performance tab)
     - Calculate latency: `UI_Update_Time - Message_Received_Time`

   - **Method 2: Console Logging**
     ```typescript
     // Add to frontend/src/hooks/useWeightScale.ts (temporary)
     ws.onmessage = (event) => {
       const receiveTime = performance.now()
       const data = JSON.parse(event.data)
       console.log(`[WebSocket] Message received at ${receiveTime}ms`)

       startTransition(() => {
         setWeight(data.weight)
         setStable(data.stable)
         const updateTime = performance.now()
         console.log(`[WebSocket] UI updated at ${updateTime}ms (latency: ${updateTime - receiveTime}ms)`)
       })
     }
     ```

**Expected Results:**

```
✅ PASS: WebSocket latency <200ms (constitutional requirement met)
✅ PASS: Average latency <100ms (excellent performance)
✅ PASS: p95 latency <150ms (95% of updates under 150ms)

⚠️  WARNING: Latency 150-200ms (acceptable but close to limit)
❌ FAIL: Latency >200ms (constitutional violation)
```

**Common Issues:**
- Network latency: Check WiFi signal strength in warehouse
- Bridge service lag: Check .NET bridge process CPU usage
- React rendering lag: Re-run Profiler to identify bottlenecks

---

### Test 5: Bundle Size Analysis

**Purpose:** Verify that optimizations didn't increase bundle size.

**Phase 1 Baseline:** 159 KB gzipped
**Target:** ≤ 200 KB gzipped (constitutional requirement)

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Run Production Build**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Analyze Bundle Size**
   - Build output shows gzipped sizes:
     ```
     dist/index.html                   0.46 kB │ gzip:  0.30 kB
     dist/assets/index-[hash].css     15.20 kB │ gzip:  3.85 kB
     dist/assets/index-[hash].js     520.45 kB │ gzip: 159.12 kB
     ```

3. **Open Bundle Visualizer** (from vite.config.ts plugin)
   - Visualizer should auto-open in browser: `dist/stats.html`
   - Inspect largest chunks:
     - Vendor chunk (React, TanStack Query, etc.)
     - Application chunk (components, pages)
     - Other chunks (modals, utilities)

4. **Compare with Phase 1 Baseline**
   - Phase 1: 159 KB gzipped
   - Phase 3: ___ KB gzipped
   - Difference: ___ KB (target: ≤ +5 KB)

**Expected Results:**

```
✅ PASS: Bundle size ≤ 200 KB gzipped (constitutional requirement)
✅ PASS: Size increase ≤ 5 KB from Phase 1 baseline (159 KB)
✅ PASS: Manual chunk splitting still working correctly

⚠️  WARNING: Size increase 5-10 KB (investigate new dependencies)
❌ FAIL: Size > 200 KB (optimization introduced bloat)
```

**Common Causes of Size Increase:**
- Unused imports (check tree-shaking)
- Large third-party dependencies (check bundle visualizer)
- Duplicate code (check chunk splitting config)

### Test 6: Lighthouse Performance Audit

**Purpose:** Measure overall performance improvement with Lighthouse.

**Phase 1 Baseline:** TBD (run baseline if not done)
**Target:** +5-10 points improvement in Performance score

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Start Frontend Preview Server**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build  # Build production version
   npm run preview  # Start preview server on port 4173
   ```

2. **Run Lighthouse Audit**
   ```bash
   npx lhci autorun
   ```

   Or manually in Chrome DevTools:

   - Click **Lighthouse** tab
   - Select:
     - Mode: **Desktop**
     - Screen: **1280 x 1024** (warehouse tablet resolution)
     - Categories: **Performance** only
   - Click **Analyze page load**

3. **Review Metrics**
   - **First Contentful Paint (FCP):** Time to first content rendered
   - **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Time to main content rendered
   - **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** Time main thread was blocked
   - **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Visual stability
   - **Speed Index (SI):** How quickly content is visually displayed

**Expected Results:**

```
✅ PASS: Performance Score 95-100 (excellent)
✅ PASS: FCP < 1.5s (target)
✅ PASS: LCP < 2.5s (target)
✅ PASS: TBT < 200ms (target)
✅ PASS: +5-10 points improvement from Phase 1

⚠️  WARNING: Performance Score 85-94 (good, but room for improvement)
❌ FAIL: Performance Score < 85 (optimization regressed performance)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: BatchItemRow Still Re-rendering All Rows

**Symptoms:**
- React DevTools Profiler shows multiple `BatchItemRow` renders
- Render reason: "Parent component rendered"

**Diagnosis:**
```typescript
// Check if memo is applied correctly:
console.log(BatchItemRow.displayName)  // Should show "BatchItemRow"
```

**Fix:**
- Verify `React.memo()` wrapper exists in `BatchTicketGrid.tsx`
- Check custom comparison function returns correct boolean
- Ensure `key` prop is stable (use `lineId` not `index`)

---

### Issue: useDeferredValue Not Working (400ms Delay)

**Symptoms:**
- Search input still has noticeable delay
- No loading spinner (⏳) appears during filtering

**Diagnosis:**
```typescript
// Check if useDeferredValue is imported and used:
import { useDeferredValue } from 'react'
const deferredSearch = useDeferredValue(searchInput)
```

**Fix:**
- Verify `useDeferredValue` import in `RunSelectionModal.tsx`
- Ensure filter uses `deferredSearch` not `searchInput`
- Check React version: Must be React 19+ (`npm list react`)

---

### Issue: WebSocket Latency >200ms

**Symptoms:**
- Weight updates appear delayed
- Latency measurements >200ms consistently

**Diagnosis:**
- Check network: `ping 192.168.0.86` (bridge server)
- Check bridge service: CPU usage, memory
- Check React rendering: Profiler shows long render times

**Fix:**
- **Network issue:** Improve WiFi signal, reduce interference
- **Bridge lag:** Optimize .NET WebSocket handler
- **React lag:** Further optimize components (virtual scrolling)

---

### Issue: Bundle Size Increased >5 KB

**Symptoms:**
- Bundle size >164 KB (159 KB + 5 KB threshold)
- Build output shows larger chunks

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check for unused imports:
npm run build -- --mode production

# Open bundle visualizer:
# Check dist/stats.html for large chunks
```

**Fix:**
- Remove unused imports (`import { memo } from 'react'` only when needed)
- Check for duplicate dependencies (`npm dedupe`)
- Verify tree-shaking: No `import *` statements

---

## Next Steps After Validation

### If All Tests Pass ✅

1. **Create Phase 3 Validation Report**
   - Document actual performance metrics
   - Compare with Phase 1 baseline
   - Calculate % improvement
