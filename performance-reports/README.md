# Performance Test Reports

This directory contains auto-generated performance test reports.

## Report Format

**Filename:** `performance_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`

**Generated By:** `scripts/run-performance-tests.sh`

**Contents:**
- Backend API performance results (p50, p95, p99 latencies)
- Frontend bundle size analysis
- WebSocket latency measurements
- Quickstart scenario validation results
- Overall constitutional compliance status

## Latest Report

To view the most recent report:

```bash
cat performance_report_*.md | tail -n 200
```

Or list all reports by date:

```bash
ls -lt performance_report_*.md
```

## Report Retention

Reports are kept for historical comparison and regression analysis. Recommended retention:
- Keep all reports for current sprint
- Archive monthly summaries
- Delete reports older than 3 months

## Baseline Metrics

When establishing performance baselines, run tests 3 times and use the median values:

```bash
cd ../scripts
./run-performance-tests.sh  # Run 1
./run-performance-tests.sh  # Run 2
./run-performance-tests.sh  # Run 3
```

Compare results to identify outliers and establish reliable baselines.
