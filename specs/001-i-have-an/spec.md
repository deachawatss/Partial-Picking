## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A warehouse operator arrives at a partial picking workstation (WS1-WS4) and needs to pick ingredients for production batches. They log in using their Active Directory credentials or SQL-based credentials stored in the warehouse management system. After authentication, they enter a production run number to retrieve the picking list. The system displays all items needed with target weights and acceptable ranges. The operator picks items from designated bins, places them on a weight scale, and the system validates the weight is within tolerance before allowing them to save. Labels print automatically for each picked item. When all items are picked, batch summary labels print for production handoff.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an operator with valid Active Directory credentials, **When** they enter username and password on the login page, **Then** the system authenticates via LDAP and navigates to the partial-picking page with their session established

2. **Given** an operator with SQL-based credentials in tbl_user, **When** they enter username and password on the login page, **Then** the system authenticates against tbl_user database table and navigates to the partial-picking page

3. **Given** an authenticated operator on the partial-picking page, **When** they enter a valid run number, **Then** the system auto-populates FG Item Key, FG Description, Batch Number(s), Production Date, and Batches count

4. **Given** an auto-populated run with batch selection, **When** the operator selects a batch number, **Then** the system displays all items for that batch with ItemKey, Description, Total Needed, Remaining Qty, and acceptable Weight Range

5. **Given** an item selected for picking, **When** the operator scans or enters a lot/bin number, **Then** the system validates the lot exists in TFC1 PARTIAL bins with available quantity (QtyOnHand - QtyCommitSales > 0)

6. **Given** a validated lot/bin assignment, **When** the operator places the item on the scale, **Then** the system displays real-time weight updates and enables "Add Lot" button only when weight is within tolerance range (±INMAST.User9)

7. **Given** weight within tolerance range, **When** the operator clicks "Add Lot" to save, **Then** the system executes 4-phase transaction (lot allocation, weight update, transaction recording, inventory commitment) and auto-prints a 4×4" item label

8. **Given** all items in all batches are picked (ItemBatchStatus = 'Allocated'), **When** the operator completes the run, **Then** the system changes status to 'PRINT', assigns pallet ID from PT sequence, and auto-prints batch summary labels (1 per batch)

9. **Given** a previously picked item, **When** the operator clicks "Delete/Unpick", **Then** the system resets PickedPartialQty to 0, deletes lot allocations, deletes transactions, decrements LotMaster.QtyCommitSales, while preserving audit trail

10. **Given** the operator is idle for more than JWT_DURATION_HOURS, **When** they attempt any action, **Then** the system requires re-authentication

### Edge Cases

- What happens when **LDAP server is unreachable**? System must allow SQL authentication fallback
- How does system handle **invalid run number entry**? Display clear error message "Run No not found"
- What happens when **no lots available for an item in TFC1 PARTIAL bins**? Display warning and suggest checking bulk storage bins (out of scope for this system)
- How does system handle **weight scale disconnection**? Display offline indicator, disable weight-dependent operations, allow reconnection
- What happens when **operator picks item out of tolerance**? Disable "Add Lot" button, display visual feedback (red indicator)
- How does system handle **duplicate lot assignment to same item in same batch**? Prevent duplicate and show warning
- What happens when **PT sequence reaches maximum value**? System administrator must reset sequence (documented procedure)
- How does system handle **concurrent picking by multiple workstations**? Each workstation operates independently; LotMaster.QtyCommitSales updates atomically
- What happens when **printer is offline during auto-print**? Queue print job and notify operator; allow manual reprint
- How does system handle **session timeout during active picking**? Preserve unsaved work in browser storage; prompt re-authentication; restore state

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- **Q**: How should the React PWA integrate with the weight scale bridge service? The Angular prototype already has a working .NET 8 WebSocket bridge service in `Weight-scale/bridge-service/`. Should we reimplement, modify, or reuse as-is? → **A**: Option A - Reuse existing `Weight-scale/bridge-service/` as-is without modifications. The WebSocket protocol is framework-agnostic (works with Angular, React, or any client). React PWA will connect to existing endpoints: `ws://localhost:5000/ws/scale/small` and `ws://localhost:5000/ws/scale/big`.

**Integration Notes**:
- Bridge service broadcasts weight data via standard WebSocket protocol (JSON messages)
- React can consume the same message format as Angular prototype
- No code changes needed in bridge service - it's frontend-agnostic
- Bridge service must be running before starting React PWA development server
- WebSocket endpoints support dual scale types per workstation (SMALL and BIG)
